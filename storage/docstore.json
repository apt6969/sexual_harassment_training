Their sexual relationship began in 1995\u2014when Clinton was 49 years old and Lewinsky was 22 years old\u2014and lasted 18 months, ending in 1997.[1] Clinton ended a televised speech in late January 1998 with the later infamous statement: \"I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky.\" Further investigation led to charges of perjury and to the impeachment of Clinton in 1998 by the U.S. House of Representatives. He was subsequently acquitted on all impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in a 21-day U.S. Senate trial.[2]\n\nClinton was held in civil contempt of court by Judge Susan Webber Wright for giving misleading testimony in the Paula Jones case regarding Lewinsky,[3] and was also fined $90,000 by Wright.[4] His license to practice law was suspended in Arkansas for five years; shortly thereafter, he was disbarred from presenting cases in front of the U.S. Supreme Court.[5]\n\nLewinsky was a graduate of Lewis & Clark College. She was hired during Clinton's first term in 1995 as an intern at the White House through the White House Internship Program and was later an employee of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs. It is believed that Clinton began a personal relationship with her while she worked at the White House, the details of which she later confided to Linda Tripp, her Defense Department co-worker who secretly recorded their telephone conversations.[6]\n\nIn January 1998, Tripp discovered that Lewinsky had sworn an affidavit in the Paula Jones case, denying a relationship with Clinton. She delivered tapes to Ken Starr, the independent counsel who was investigating Clinton on other matters, including the Whitewater scandal, the White House FBI files controversy, and the White House travel office controversy. During the grand jury testimony, Clinton's responses were carefully worded, and he argued \"it depends on what the meaning of the word is is\",[7] with regard to the truthfulness of his statement that \"there is not a sexual relationship, an improper sexual relationship or any other kind of improper relationship\".[8]\n\nThis scandal is sometimes referred to as \"Monicagate\",[9] \"Lewinskygate\",[10] \"Tailgate\",[11] \"Sexgate\",[12] and \"Zippergate\",[12] following the \"-gate\" construction that has been used since the Watergate scandal.\n\nAllegations of sexual contact\n\nMonica Lewinsky in May 1997\nLewinsky said she had sexual encounters with Bill Clinton on nine occasions from November 1995 to March 1997. According to her published schedule, First Lady Hillary Clinton was at the White House for at least some portion of seven of those days.[13]\n\nIn April 1996, Lewinsky's superiors relocated her job to the Pentagon, because they felt she was spending too much time around Clinton.[14] According to his autobiography, then-United Nations Ambassador Bill Richardson was asked by the White House in 1997 to interview Lewinsky for a job on his staff at the United Nations. Richardson did so, and offered her a position, which she declined.[15] The American Spectator alleged that Richardson knew more about the Lewinsky affair than he declared to the grand jury.[16]\n\nLewinsky confided in Linda Tripp about her relationship with Clinton.[17] Tripp persuaded Lewinsky to save the gifts Clinton had given her, and not to dry clean a semen-stained blue dress in order to keep it as an \"insurance policy.\"[17] Tripp reported their conversations to literary agent Lucianne Goldberg, who advised her to secretly record them,[18] which Tripp began doing in September 1997. Goldberg also urged Tripp to take the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and bring them to the attention of people working on the Paula Jones case.[19] In the fall of 1997, Goldberg began speaking to reporters (including Michael Isikoff of Newsweek) about the tapes.[20]\n\nIn the Paula Jones case, Lewinsky had submitted an affidavit that denied any physical relationship with Clinton. In January 1998, she attempted to persuade Tripp to commit perjury in the Jones case. Instead, Tripp gave the tapes to Starr, who was investigating the Whitewater controversy and other matters. Starr was now armed with evidence of Lewinsky's admission of a physical relationship with Clinton, and he broadened the investigation to include Lewinsky and her possible perjury in the Jones case.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4469, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e0b3522-3cfb-4d00-b6f0-265dd58bbb3d": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e0b3522-3cfb-4d00-b6f0-265dd58bbb3d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "training/clinton_lewinsky.txt", "file_name": "clinton_lewinsky.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 17050, "creation_date": "2024-02-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-16", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "74707412-4e99-4590-88fe-880c2a0a79a7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "training/clinton_lewinsky.txt", "file_name": "clinton_lewinsky.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 17050, "creation_date": "2024-02-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-16", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-16"}, "hash": "981a1c5f783f8906c03533a2214b37f094211dec4368937ad2027a6fd6e2412c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3425beec-8980-48af-b344-24fcf8abc73f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "training/clinton_lewinsky.txt", "file_name": "clinton_lewinsky.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 17050, "creation_date": "2024-02-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-16", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-16"}, "hash": "883bf9004b564bdb6e7583952bb8464a8a4dacb900bc4decb1614bc50e72db64", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "16d45ae4-7a2c-49e7-98d9-79f0cd175ce7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8ce7170a5a711a712e0e40323cf5dfd901e178ad3abeb5e855aacbcf1f8ba0ce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Goldberg also urged Tripp to take the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and bring them to the attention of people working on the Paula Jones case.[19] In the fall of 1997, Goldberg began speaking to reporters (including Michael Isikoff of Newsweek) about the tapes.[20]\n\nIn the Paula Jones case, Lewinsky had submitted an affidavit that denied any physical relationship with Clinton.

See media help.\nNews of the scandal first broke on January 17, 1998, on the Drudge Report,[21] which reported that Newsweek editors were sitting on a story by investigative reporter Michael Isikoff exposing the affair. The story broke in the mainstream press on January 21 in The Washington Post.[22] The story swirled for several days and, despite swift denials from Clinton, the clamor for answers from the White House grew louder. On January 26, President Clinton, standing with his wife, spoke at a White House press conference, and issued a denial in which he said:[23]\n\nNow, I have to go back to work on my State of the Union speech. And I worked on it until pretty late last night. But I want to say one thing to the American people. I want you to listen to me. I'm going to say this again: I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie, not a single time; never. These allegations are false. And I need to go back to work for the American people. Thank you.[24]\n\nPundits debated whether Clinton would address the allegations in his State of the Union Address. Ultimately, he chose not to mention them. Hillary Clinton remained supportive of her husband throughout the scandal.[25] On January 27, in an appearance on NBC's Today she said, \"The great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president.\"[26]\n\nFor the next several months and through the summer, the media debated whether or not an affair had occurred and whether or not Clinton had lied or obstructed justice, but nothing could be definitively established beyond the taped recordings because Lewinsky was unwilling to discuss the affair or testify about it. On July 28, 1998, a substantial delay after the public break of the scandal, Lewinsky received transactional immunity in exchange for grand jury testimony concerning her relationship with Clinton.[27] She also turned over a semen-stained blue dress (which Tripp had encouraged her to save without dry cleaning) to the Starr investigators. The FBI tested the dress and matched the semen stains to a blood sample from Clinton, thereby providing unambiguous DNA evidence that could prove the relationship despite Clinton's official denials.[28]\n\nClinton admitted in taped grand jury testimony on August 17, 1998, that he had engaged in an \"improper physical relationship\" with Lewinsky. That evening he gave a nationally televised statement admitting that his relationship with Lewinsky was \"not appropriate\".[29][30]\n\nOn August 20, 1998, three days after Clinton testified on the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Operation Infinite Reach launched missiles against al-Qaeda bases in Khost, Afghanistan, and the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum, Sudan, in retaliation for the 1998 United States embassy bombings.[31] Some countries, media outlets, protesters, and Republicans accused Clinton of ordering the attacks as a diversion.[32][33] The attacks also drew parallels to the then-recently released movie Wag the Dog, which features a fictional president faking a war in Albania to distract attention from a sex scandal.", "start_char_idx": 3685, "end_char_idx": 8257, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16d45ae4-7a2c-49e7-98d9-79f0cd175ce7": {"__data__": {"id_": "16d45ae4-7a2c-49e7-98d9-79f0cd175ce7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "training/clinton_lewinsky.txt", "file_name": "clinton_lewinsky.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 17050, "creation_date": "2024-02-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-16", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "74707412-4e99-4590-88fe-880c2a0a79a7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "training/clinton_lewinsky.txt", "file_name": "clinton_lewinsky.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 17050, "creation_date": "2024-02-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-16", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-16"}, "hash": "981a1c5f783f8906c03533a2214b37f094211dec4368937ad2027a6fd6e2412c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5e0b3522-3cfb-4d00-b6f0-265dd58bbb3d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "training/clinton_lewinsky.txt", "file_name": "clinton_lewinsky.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 17050, "creation_date": "2024-02-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-16", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-16"}, "hash": "6c14f673c9a966acd3d157d18454ce15758635a7486467869dfa50f70197cd18", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "54a579cf-95fc-4763-96fa-88775ccfa9c5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "77a8486b2dfc953579473ccec323d8abebc89300177c18a76accb1425f20b3cf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[28]\n\nClinton admitted in taped grand jury testimony on August 17, 1998, that he had engaged in an \"improper physical relationship\" with Lewinsky.

This conspiracy theory would influence Mohamed Atta, the ringleader of al-Qaeda's Hamburg cell and the September 11 attacks.[39]\n\nPerjury charges\nIn his deposition for the Jones lawsuit, Clinton denied having sexual relations with Lewinsky. Based on the evidence\u2014a blue dress with Clinton's semen that Lewinsky provided\u2014Starr concluded that the president's sworn testimony was false and perjurious.\n\nDuring the deposition, Clinton was asked \"Have you ever had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, as that term is defined in Deposition Exhibit 1?\" The judge ordered that Clinton be given an opportunity to review the agreed definition. Afterwards, based on the definition created by the Independent Counsel's Office, Clinton answered, \"I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.\" Clinton later said, \"I thought the definition included any activity by [me], where [I] was the actor and came in contact with those parts of the bodies\" which had been explicitly listed (and \"with an intent to gratify or arouse the sexual desire of any person\"). In other words, Clinton denied that he had ever contacted Lewinsky's \"genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks\", and effectively claimed that the agreed-upon definition of \"sexual relations\" included giving oral sex but excluded receiving oral sex.[40]\n\nTwo months after the Senate failed to convict him, President Clinton was held in civil contempt of court by Judge Susan Webber Wright for giving misleading testimony regarding his sexual relationship with Lewinsky, and was also fined $90,000 by Wright.[3][4] Clinton declined to appeal the civil contempt of court ruling, citing financial problems,[3] but still maintained that his testimony complied with Wright's earlier definition of sexual relations.[3] In 2001, his license to practice law was suspended in Arkansas for five years and later by the United States Supreme Court.[5]\n\nImpeachment\nMain article: Impeachment of Bill Clinton\nIn December 1998, Clinton's Democratic political party was in the minority in both chambers of Congress. A few Democratic members of Congress, and most in the opposition Republican Party, claimed that Clinton's giving false testimony and allegedly influencing Lewinsky's testimony were crimes of obstruction of justice and perjury and thus impeachable offenses. After a delay due to a brief bombing campaign in Iraq, the House of Representatives voted to issue two Articles of Impeachment against him which was followed by a 21-day trial in the Senate.\n\nClinton was acquitted on both counts as neither received the necessary two-thirds majority vote of the senators present. Between 45 and 50 senators voted to convict, depending on the charge, short of the 67 votes needed for conviction and removal from office.[41] All the Democrats in the Senate voted for acquittal on both the perjury and the obstruction of justice charges. Ten Republicans voted for acquittal for perjury: John Chafee (Rhode Island), Susan Collins (Maine), Slade Gorton (Washington), Jim Jeffords (Vermont), Richard Shelby (Alabama), Olympia Snowe (Maine), Arlen Specter (Pennsylvania), Ted Stevens (Alaska), Fred Thompson (Tennessee), and John Warner (Virginia). Five Republicans voted for acquittal for obstruction of justice: Chafee, Collins, Jeffords, Snowe, and Specter.\n\nPresident Clinton was thereby acquitted of all charges and remained in office.

There were attempts to censure the president by the House of Representatives, but those attempts failed.\n\nAftermath\nEffect on 2000 presidential election\nThe scandal arguably affected the 2000 U.S. presidential election in two quite different ways. Democratic Party candidate and sitting vice president Al Gore said that Clinton's scandal had been \"a drag\" that deflated the enthusiasm of their party's base, and had the effect of reducing Democratic votes. Clinton said the scandal had made Gore's campaign too cautious, and that if Clinton had been allowed to campaign for Gore in Arkansas and New Hampshire, either state would have delivered Gore's needed electoral votes regardless of the effects of the Florida recount controversy.[42]\n\nPolitical analysts have supported both views. Before and after the 2000 election, John Cochran of ABC News connected the Lewinsky scandal with a voter phenomenon he called \"Clinton fatigue\".[43] Polling showed that the scandal continued to affect Clinton's low personal approval ratings through the election,[44] and analysts such as Vanderbilt University's John G. Geer later concluded \"Clinton fatigue or a kind of moral retrospective voting had a significant impact on Gore's chances\".[45] Other analysts sided with Clinton's argument, and argued that Gore's refusal to have Clinton campaign with him damaged his appeal.[46][47][48][unreliable source?][49]\n\nCollateral scandals\nDuring the scandal, supporters of former president Clinton alleged that the matter should remain private, and called some supporting Clinton's impeachment hypocritical. A highly publicized investigation campaign actively sought information that might embarrass politicians who supported impeachment. According to the British newspaper The Guardian,\n\nLarry Flynt ... the publisher of Hustler magazine, offered a $1 million reward ... Flynt was a sworn enemy of the Republican party [and] sought to dig up dirt on the Republican members of Congress who were leading the impeachment campaign against President Clinton. [...
